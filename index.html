		<h2>Police Shooting Data</h2>
		<p class="subhed">From 2016 to 2022</p>
		<p class="byline">Madyson Diaz</p>
		
		<p>Below you will find my Datawrapper chart and my creative dataviz. Both depict the same data just in slightly different forms. I will first discuss the decisions I made regarding my Datawrapper chart before moving on to my creative dataviz. I will also reflect on what I may change now if I were to edit both again.</p>
		<p>I find that my Datawrapper chart is very straight forward; it is a bar graph. The x-axis contains years ranging from 2016 to 2022. The y-axis is numbered 0 to 1,200 at intervals of 200. The y-axis represents the number of police shootings. It is clear to see in the graph that the number of police shootings has been steadily increasing a little bit every year. I made the decision to make the bars red considering that the graph depicts quite the level of violence. Considering how straight forward the chart is, I don't think there is anything I would change. It does exactly what I need it to.</p>
		<p>My creative dataviz reflects the same data as described above with slightly different formatting. In creative dataviz shows a gun firing bullets and the bullets keep getting slightly higher. The x-axis still contains years ranging from 2016 to 2022 but there isn't exactly a y-axis. Instead, the number of police shootings is listed above each bullet. The dataviz is also drawn in pencil with no shading. What I would change now is to add shading to the dataviz and outline the images with sharpee. I would also maybe add some red to the end of each bullet to depict blood. Other than the little bit of red, I wouldn't add any other color considering the somber topic of the dataviz.</p>
